NAME
    dovecot-antispam - The dovecot plugin for spam systems training.

DISCLAIMER
    This is the fork of the antispam dovecot plugin as the original one is
    aimed for dovecot versions before 2.0 and the respectful authors weren't
    going to update it.

    You can find the original version at
    http://johannes.sipsolutions.net/Projects/dovecot-antispam

    Even though most of the things were adopted, some things did change.
    Please read this manual carefully. You have been warned.

DESCRIPTION
    The dovecot antispam plugin is aimed to help in spam systems training.
    Consider the following scenario. Your mailbox is flooded with tons of mail.
    They are delivered to the configured folders based on the arbitrary spam
    system judgement. This judgement is not always correct or not always what
    you would like it to be, however. This is where this plugin comes into play.

    All you have to do is move the mail into the correct folder. All the rest
    in order to let the spam system know it made an error will be done
    automatically by this plugin.

    It watches for when you move the mail to some folder and acts accordingly.
    The advantage of this approach is that the mail ends up in the right target
    folder directly and needs not be touched twice.

FOLDER MATRIX
    This plugin has internally four types of folders. Different actions are
    programmed when you move the mail from one folder to the other.
    The following table describes the actions depending on the source and
    destination folders.

BACKENDS
    The plugin supports multiple backends, for different kinds of spam systems.

 MAILTRAIN
    This backend is aimed to send mail to some e-mail address for retraining.
    Which makes it very fast to set up if you already have a working setup that
    uses training addresses as recommended by many spam systems.

    Since this backend simply pipes the message to an external program it can
    also be used for all kinds of other spam systems with help of the wrapper
    to make all the work for you. E.g. for spamassassin you can call sa-learn
    or spamc.

 SPOOL2DIR
    This backend spools the message into a file. No further processing is
    performed. You need to write an extra daemon that picks up the spooled files
    and trains the spam filter appropriately. You can, for example, use incron
    to pick up new mail from those files.

 DSPAM
    This backend instantly retrains by calling dspam client with appropriate
    arguments. There is an ability to circumvent mail retraining based on an
    arbitrary header (configurable) value.

 CRM114
    This backend instantly retrains by calling mailreaver.crm script.
    The command line argument --good or --spam (by default) is given depending
    on how the mail is moved.

    You need to use the unsure folder option (see below) together with this
    plugin and deliver unsure mail into an UNSURE folder, spam mail into a
    SPAM folder and other mail regularly.

 SIGNATURE-LOG
    This backend collects the information about the mails in the dovecot
    dictionary incrementing the value of the name-value pair each time the
    message is retrained as spam and decrementing each time otherwise.
    Further processing of the dictionary contents is left to be the user's
    responsibility.

INSTALLATION
    Open your dovecot configuration file (usually /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf)
    and add the antispam plugin to the imap protocol section:

	protocol imap {
	    mail_plugins = $mail_plugins antispam
	}

CONFIGURATION
    All of the run-time configuration options shown below are to be put into
    the plugin section of the dovecot configuration file.

 PARAMETER TYPES
    string  Case-sensitive string;
    istring  Case-insensitive string;
    lstring  Case-sensitive string list, semicolon separated;
    ilstring  Case-insensitive string list, semicolon separated;
    boolean  Case-insensitive boolean (YES/NO);

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
    antispam_backend (istring)  Selects the specific backend to be used for spam
    system training. Obligatory, default = NONE.

    antispam_allow_append_to_spam (boolean)  Specifies whether to allow
    appending mails to the spam folder from the unknown source. See the
    ALLOWING APPENDS section below for the details on why it is not advised
    to turn this option on. Optional, default = NO.

    antispam_skip_from_line (boolean)  Specifies whether to skip the leading
    "From " line of the mail piped to the backend processor.
    Optional, default = NO.

 FOLDER OPTIONS
    You must configure the list for at least one of the SPAM, TRASH, and UNSURE
    folders using the following parameters. By default all of them are unset.

    antispam_spam, antispam_trash, antispam_unsure (lstring)  static lists to
    match the folder names literally case sensitive.

    antispam_spam_pattern, antispam_trash_pattern, antispam_unsure_pattern (lstring)  
    wildcard lists to match the beginning of the folder names. I.e. wildcard
    could be specified in the end only. Identical to the static lists otherwise.

    same as the previous, but case insensitive.

 SIGNATURE ENGINE OPTIONS
    Several backends are based on the signature header processing.

    antispam_signature (string)  header name to extract the mail signature from.
    Obligatory, default = NONE.

    antispam_signature_missing (istring)  specifies what to do if the signature
    header is missing. Possible values: "move" (move the mail silently without
    training), "error" (display an error stating that the signature header is
    missing). Optional, default = "error".

 MAILTRAIN SPECIFIC OPTIONS

 SPOOL2DIR SPECIFIC OPTIONS
    Both options below must have "%%lu" specified with any legal C modifier two
    times. The first one is replaced with the current time (epoch). The second
    one is replaced with the incrementing counter to make sure the file name is
    unique.

    marked as SPAM. Obligatory, default = NONE.

    antispam_spool2dir_notspam (string)  filename template with full path for
    mails marked as not SPAM. Obligatory, default = NONE.

 DSPAM SPECIFIC OPTIONS
    This backend is based on the signature engine.

    antispam_dspam_result_blacklist (ilstring)  specifies the list of
    classification results to avoid retraining for. Optional, default = NONE.

 CRM114 SPECIFIC OPTIONS
    This backend is based on the signature engine.

    antispam_crm_binary (string)  specifies the path to the mailreaver.crm
    script. Optional, default = "/usr/share/crm114/mailreaver.crm".

    antispam_crm_args (lstring)  list of command line arguments to the
    mailreaver.crm script. Optional, default = NONE.

    antispam_crm_spam (string)  command line argument to specify that mail

    antispam_siglog_dict_uri (string)  specifies the URI of the dovecot
    dictionary to connect to. Obligatory, default = NONE.

    antispam_siglog_dict_user (string)  specifies the user credentials used
    to connect to the dovecot dictionary. Obligatory, default = NONE.

ALLOWING APPENDS
    By appends we mean the case of mail moving when the source folder is
    unknown, e.g. when you move from some other account or with tools like
    offlineimap. You should be careful with allowing APPENDs to SPAM folders.
    The reason for possibly allowing it is to allow not-SPAM --> SPAM
    transitions to work and be trained. However, because the plugin cannot
    know the source of the message (it is assumed to be from OTHER folder),
    multiple bad scenarios can happen:

    1. SPAM --> SPAM transitions cannot be recognised and are trained;
    2. TRASH --> SPAM transitions cannot be recognised and are trained;
    3. SPAM --> not-SPAM transitions cannot be recognised therefore training
    good messages will never work with APPENDs.
